 <p>My name is AYOMIDE OLORUNTOISN THOMAS I am dark in completion I am 20 years old I stay at 69 Aina street off surulere lagos state NIGERIA.  I am currently a student of federal university of technology of AKURE  I study very hard to achieve my goals, I am pretty much an average student by grade.</p>  
<p> Ever since I was little kid I have always had this dream to become a professional pilot that all I always wanted as a kid but as time goes on most would have discover many other things to become cause time flies but I don’t know I am kind of different in that way I still always wanted to be a pilot as much, But someone is goanna have to a make a living so decided, But now I am into engineering is one of the things I love doing most when I was kid to repair things as my father always says every kid as talent in them you just have to trigger it and when I mean trigger some  people discover  they are late I discover mine a little too early and when I mean early like I was 9 years old when I start to repair my TV remote and all and it grow from there still now I guess old habit don’t die hard I guess.</p> <p> During my school days I was  a big win and when I mean big win, I was the health prefect in a public school called ERINOSO NUR and PRIMARY SCHOOL and I was loved by all the teacher and secondary school I was the HEADBOY there is private school name “DE GIFTED PRIVATE SCHOOL”  loved by the teachers too and I am a very ambitious guy all my life and I hope to achieve more.</p>
<p> I am single,Then I am the first born of my family I am about eight feet tall. My goal is to be one of the greatest programmer and that is one of my ambition. I am straight forward guy and GOD fearing, I am a Christian.</p>
<p>
Because ever since I was little kid I have wanted to know how things are made, engineering is very fun to learn. I found engineering fun because you get to fix things, solve problem, scientific or manually. It has contributed a lot to human race as whole and done so many things in our world today, and my whole life has been about solving problem, finding a way where there seem to be no way, and the best part is that I have been surviving. So that why I love engineering so much cause is about solving problems and learning how to fix them as well.I really look forward into bringing this world a better place some day  </p>
<p> I hope you find these interesting and give me a call THANK YOU </p>
